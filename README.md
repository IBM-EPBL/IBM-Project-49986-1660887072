## Aim

To develop a problem statement for a Novel Method For Handwritten Digit
Recognition System.

## Problem Statement
Handwriting recognition is one of the compelling research works going on
because every individual in this world has their own style of writing. It is the capability
of the computer to identify and understand handwritten digits or characters automatically.
Because of the progress in the field of science and technology, everything is being
digitalized to reduce human effort. Hence, there comes a need for handwritten digit
recognition in many real-time applications. The MNIST data set is widely used for this
recognition process and it has 70000 handwritten digits. We use Artificial neural
networks to train these images and build a deep learning model. Web application is
created where the user can upload an image of a handwritten digit. This image is
analyzed by the model and the detected result is returned on to the UI. In the Banking
Sector too where more handwritten numbers are involved like account number, figure of
cash and cheques.
